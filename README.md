## üì¶ Product Description

This project aims to develop a multi-functional AI application that:
- Detects **skin diseases** using deep learning 
- Provides personalized recommendations based on detected results
- Stores and refines data continuously for active learning

## ‚ùó Problem Statement  
 
Skin conditions, lesions, and wounds are among the most common health issues affecting people worldwide. Many individuals delay or avoid consulting a dermatologist due to cost, accessibility issues, or the belief that their condition is not serious. This delay can lead to worsening of the condition, increased healthcare costs, and negative impacts on overall well-being.  
 
Additionally, people often struggle to get timely appointments with dermatologists at hospitals, facing long waiting lists and overcrowded clinics. Even when appointments are available, consultations can be expensive, creating a barrier for those who need early evaluation and care.  
 
There is currently a lack of accessible, reliable, and easy-to-use digital tools that can help users identify potential skin issues early and guide them toward appropriate care. While some applications offer basic skin analysis, they are often limited in accuracy, lack real-time updates, or fail to provide actionable recommendations for users.  
 
To address this gap, we designed **Dermin**, a web application powered by artificial intelligence. Dermin allows users to capture images of their skin lesions or conditions, classifies them using advanced computer vision models, and provides tailored recommendations and guidance. By combining AI-driven classification with user-friendly design, Dermin aims to improve early detection, increase awareness, and make dermatological support more accessible to everyone.

 
## üéØ Objectives  
 
- To create an accessible and intuitive web application that allows users to take photos of their skin conditions easily.  
- To classify skin lesions, wounds, or conditions using a reliable and updatable AI model.  
- To provide users with meaningful insights, suggestions, and guidance for further medical attention if necessary.  
- To continuously improve the AI model and segmentation through feedback loops and new user data.  
- To make dermatological support more inclusive, affordable, and available beyond traditional healthcare settings.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Sprint Review

- It was concluded that the **YOLOv8n** model was weak for production use, and the team decided to switch to **YOLOv8s**. Transition to a higher-capacity model may be considered in the upcoming sprint.
- The dataset used for training the **YOLOv8s** model was found to be highly noisy. Therefore, data cleaning or the selection of a new, cleaner dataset is being considered.
- Due to local hardware limitations, training took a significantly long time. Cloud-based training solutions are currently being evaluated.
- The database structure has not been fully finalized. In **Sprint 3**, a final decision will be made, and the required backend integrations will be implemented.
- The targeted number of survey participants for **Module-2** has not yet been reached.
- The project logo will be selected through a voting process.

## üîÅ Sprint Retrospective

- A **KVKK (Personal Data Protection Law)** notice will be added to the homepage.  
- If the required number of users is reached for **Module-2**, data analysis and segmentation will be performed, and the results will be integrated with other modules.
- **Module-3** chatbot integration will be finalized.
- It was agreed that the **database structure** and **backend connections** should be completed as soon as possible.
- The **frontend** will be updated based on the selected logo and color palette.
- Final polishing will be applied to the **YOLO model**, **backend**, and **frontend** components.
