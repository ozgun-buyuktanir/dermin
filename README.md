- **Gemini** was selected as the Large Language Model (LLM) for integration.  
- **Daily Scrum** meetings were held regularly, and screenshots of backlogs and meetings were documented.

## 🧠 Point Allocation Logic

- **Sprint 1** was dedicated to research, frontend development, and a small portion of the backend.  
  It was estimated to require approximately **25–30%** of the total project effort.  
  The total effort allocated to Sprint 1 was set at **250 points**.

- **Sprint 2** focused on the development of:
  - **Module 1**: Image Classification
  - **Module 2**: User Segmentation with LLM-powered Chatbot  
  This sprint was estimated to cover roughly **40%** of the total effort, with **350 points** allocated.

- **Sprint 3** will be dedicated to completing delayed tasks and polishing the product.  
  It was planned to represent the remaining **30%** of the total effort, with **300 points** assigned.



### 📊 Total Effort

The project was estimated to require **900 points** of total effort, distributed across three sprints as follows:

- **Sprint 1**: 250 points (~27.78%)  
- **Sprint 2**: 350 points (~38.89%)  
- **Sprint 3**: 300 points (~33.33%)

## 📝 Sprint Notes

- **YOLOv8n** was selected for demonstration purposes.
- **YOLOv8s** was trained and finalized as the main model.
- **Module-2** was designed as a survey-based user segmentation module and will be integrated with **Module-1** and **Module-3** to provide personalized data flow.
- The database was migrated from **Firebase** to **MongoDB** due to Firebase's pay-as-you-go pricing policy.
- The project logo and color palette have been *temporarily* finalized and are subject to *future revisions*.
- **Daily Scrum** meetings were conducted regularly, with screenshots of backlogs and meetings properly documented.

## ✒️ Sprint Review

- It was concluded that the **YOLOv8n** model was weak for production use, and the team decided to switch to **YOLOv8s**. Transition to a higher-capacity model may be considered in the upcoming sprint.
- The dataset used for training the **YOLOv8s** model was found to be highly noisy. Therefore, data cleaning or the selection of a new, cleaner dataset is being considered.
- Due to local hardware limitations, training took a significantly long time. Cloud-based training solutions are currently being evaluated.
- The database structure has not been fully finalized. In **Sprint 3**, a final decision will be made, and the required backend integrations will be implemented.
- The targeted number of survey participants for **Module-2** has not yet been reached.
- The project logo will be selected through a voting process.

## 🔁 Sprint Retrospective

- A **KVKK (Personal Data Protection Law)** notice will be added to the homepage.  
- If the required number of users is reached for **Module-2**, data analysis and segmentation will be performed, and the results will be integrated with other modules.
- **Module-3** chatbot integration will be finalized.
- It was agreed that the **database structure** and **backend connections** should be completed as soon as possible.
- The **frontend** will be updated based on the selected logo and color palette.
- Final polishing will be applied to the **YOLO model**, **backend**, and **frontend** components.
